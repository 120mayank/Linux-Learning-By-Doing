Linux is an open-source computer operating system originally developed for use on personal computers but now broadly used on smartphones, servers, mainframe computers, supercomputers and more.
Created by Linus Torvalds at the University of Helsinki in 1991, the operating system is free to install and redistribute for any purpose, which has helped to make it the most popular computer operating system in use today.
Versions of the Linux operating system are used on tablets, smartphones and other devices using the Android OS, web servers, smart TVs, gaming devices and much more.
The Linux Foundation was created in 2000 to promote the use and development of Linux.
The Foundation sponsors the further development of the Linux OS by Torvalds and conducts Linux training certification courses, manages open source projects and hosts Linux conferences and events around the world.
